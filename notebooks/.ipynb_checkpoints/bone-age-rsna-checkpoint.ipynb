    "The primary purpose of this dataset is to determine a person's age based on their bone structure examined in an x-ray. The real value of this is determining how mature a person's skeleton is to determine if the patient has any perceptible growth defects, especially for children. For example, if a person's skeleton indicates that they should be 7 years old, but they are in fact 10, they are likely suffering from some sort of endocrine disorder. However, there are not many good quantitative measures for this, even fewer of which are fast and fully automated.\n",
